THis is the record of what I have attempted to do while following the video and written notes to Project1 on hackingwithswift.com tutorial, based on project building as a way to learn how to build an App

To start I created a folder on my desktop called HackingWithSwift and the created a folder within that folder called "project 1"

I then launched Xcode ( version 11.5) and did as suggested "Create a new Xcode project".
Then... "Single View App (Application?)  -> "Next"
Then... on the "choose options for your new project" window there are a couple of differences from the window on the version in Hackingwithswift site than that on the version I have ....namely

    1: Product Name:....same
    2:before "organization Name" in my version I have "Team" ( add account)
    3: Organization Identifier:...same
    4: Bundle Identifier:...same
    5: Language:...options...1: Swift.. same
    6: on my version this is "User Interface" while on the hackingwithswift it has "devices"
        I have gone with storyboard on the dropdown as there is no "Universal" as suggested in the tutorial.
    7: Use Core Data... same
            no sub menu "Use CloudKit"... in hackingwithswift
    8: Include Unit Tests..same
    9: Include UI Tests...same
                 
                 
 when it comes to choosing an iOS simulator the option to select iPhone XR is not available so I have choosen iPhone SE
 
 Now it starts to get interesting!!!!
 
 as directed.... use link...no sign of project1 folder
 
                 use link to "master.zip......404 error
                 
 so went to GitHub direct and found the Project1 folder but not the folder called "contents"
