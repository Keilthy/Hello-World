Wish I had found GitHub years ago.... it really suites my way of doing things or should I say the way I manage not to do things.!!!
I have an idea it developes into another idea and another and then maybe another and then back to the original. 
So I'm fairly confident that if I stick with the plan, as regards "learning GitHub" , I will ifg noting else .....Learn GitHub!!!

initially I wanted  to get familiar with the functionality of the packge so tat I could confidently access the repositories of hackingWithSwift and their project filesbut after successfully accessing the Project1 files I 
realise I now need to familiatrize myself with the "forum"aspect of the package (GitHub) so that I can find out why the code that I downloaded to a local file to deploy in the Xcode package didnt work.

Is it because the Xcode version the code was designed for no longer works or is it y because `i've done something wrong????...
