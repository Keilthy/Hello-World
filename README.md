# MakeAnApp
My first repository in gitHub

I'm going to see if I can learn how to make an App by learning the process through an actual build project.

So I have found a site hackingwithswift.com and will see how that goes. they are using Github and I have downloaded the files frommtheir repository on project on.

the files I HAVE SAVE TO A LOCAL FILE ON MY DESKTOP. 

I tried to open the files in desktop GitHubbut something went wrong or I more than likely did something incorrect.
