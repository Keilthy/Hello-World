MakeAnApp

I think the best way to make an App is to first learn How and when I see the how , The What will have critiera on which the design can be based.

To acquire the "How", I'm going to try and learn Swift and use it within the iOS eviroment using Xcode as the builder of projects

I will be using GitHub to record and store all useful info but must first learn how to use GitHub

See the Project MakeAnApp in projects in GitHub to track my ideas on the strategy behind the project
